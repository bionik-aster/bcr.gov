          <h1>Citizenship</h1>
          <h2>Applying for citizenship</h2>
          <p>Citizenship of the Virtual Bench (see <a href="../government/">Government</a>) can be requested through the Discord server, found in the footer below every page of this website. Citizenship of the Physical Bench however requires you to have witnessed it firsthand.</p>
          <h3>Border Guard</h3>
          <p>Maintained by the <i>Bureau of Internal Security</i>, the Border Guard is the primary decisive factor as to whether you are permitted into the nation or not. They, along with the General Secretary and other Bureau Secretaries, hold the final say in your citizenship.</p>
          <h2>Link to the Immigration Portal</h2>
          <a href="/bcr_immigration/">Link to the portal here</a>
          <br>
          <p>The link teleports you to a website created by the same person who created this website, and the button there transports you yet again to a google forms to apply for citizenship.</p>
          <h2>Citizenship and Deportation</h2>
          <p>Depending on the severity of the crime, since the BCR cannot legally enforce capital nor corporal punishment, any severe enough crime will warrant either a blacklist or deportation, regardless of your citizenship status.</p>
          <h2>Honorifics</h2>
          <p>Honorific systems are strictly limited to administrative roles in the Communist Republic, disregarding all contribution-based honorifics apart from the Order of the Benchic Star (OBST), given for excellent service directly related to National Security.</p>
