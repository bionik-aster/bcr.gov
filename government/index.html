          <h1>Government</h1>
          <h2>Administration</h2>
          <p>The Bench Communist Republic's administration lies within its representatives of each Zone in the Physical Bench, while it is controlled entirely by the General Secretary in the Virtual Bench.</p>
          <h2>Physical Bench</h2>
          <p>It is the territory that the Bench Communist Republic actually claims, within the city of Birmingham, United Kingdom.</p>
          <h3>Representatives</h3>
          <a href="https://bcr.fandom.com/Representative/"><em>Read more on the Wiki</em></a>
          <br>
          <p>The Representatives are individuals that represent each of the Zones in the Physical Bench, in the United Kingdom. Currently, there are 6 Zones, of which 3 are permanently represented.</p>
          <h2>Virtual Bench</h2>
          <p>It is the Discord server that the Bench Communist Republic owns. It has a different administrative structure to the Physical Bench.</p>
          <h3>Ordinance of Absolute Governance</h3>
          <p>This is the ordinance declaring the absolute power that the General Secretary holds over the Virtual Bench, and does not affect the Physical Bench. Moderation and lower administration is done by the Bureau Secretaries.</p>
          <h1>Law and Justice System</h1>
          <h2>Judiciary</h2>
          <p>The justice system consists of the Bureau of Justice, Bureau of Internal Security, and the General Secretary. They are able to create courts with inferior judicial power to their own according to Article VI, Section 1 of the Constitution.</p>
          <h3>Secretary of Justice and Secretary of Internal Security</h3>
          <p>Represented by the same person, the Secretary of Justice and Internal Security is the head of the National Intelligence Central Agency, the micronation's police force and intelligence agency.</p>
